# Contributing

Every contributions are welcome ! Feel free to create issues, add documentation or features to the project !

To make Banksy an awesome project, we need you to respect some guidelines :straight_ruler: 

- Every issue needs to be detailed. If it's about a bug, don't just say "*this doesn't work !*". Describe your problem, and if possible, tell how to reproduce it. If the issue is about adding a functionality, describe in detail what you want to be added, so that the person(s) assigned to this issue can develop it in the best way possible.
- When submitting a pull request that changes the code of the application, make sure that it's well documented, both by documenting the functionalities that you added, and by commenting your code (every part that is a little tricky needs to be documented, and there is never too much documentation !).
- We love nice and beautiful code, so please follow the coding best practices.
- Commit with explicit messages, so that we know exactly what you did without looking everywhere in your code.


Thank you :raised_hands:
